# MOTION PROFILING IN A STRAIGHT LINE

Math involves knowing maximum velocity and max acceleration.
Calculates ideal velocity and position to get to desired distance. 

### Which unit should I use?
Unit can be anything as long as it is consistant. <br> 
For example: <br>
If we want the robot/vehicle to move 10 **inches** forward, then the velocity would need to be **inches per second (in/sec)**
and acceleration would be **inches per second per second (inches/second^2)**.
